# Welcome to my third entry

**Hello world**, this is my second Jekyll blog post.

I hope you like it!

**Today's notes**
I learned several tools to help me navigate the terminal and make commits:  
git add  
git branch -v  
git stash  
git stash pop (less common)  
git status (most common / useful)  
git commit   
git remote -v  
git push

I also learned that the journal can be edited through gitpd and I downloaded the Chrome plugin to do so.

Another way to put a space between lines is "<br/>" which stands for break
